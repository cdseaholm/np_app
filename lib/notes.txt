### flutterfire

    when adding new firebase flutterfire configuration:

    From your Flutter project directory, run the following command:


    flutter pub add PLUGIN_NAME
    From your Flutter project directory, run the following command:


    flutterfire configure
    Running this command ensures that your Flutter app's Firebase configuration is up-to-date and, for Crashlytics and Performance Monitoring on Android, adds the required Gradle plugins to your app.

    Once complete, rebuild your Flutter project:


    flutter run
